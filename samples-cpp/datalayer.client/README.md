# README datalayer.client

The sample app __datalayer.client__ performs Data Layer operations in cpp.

## Introduction

It demonstrates how values of existing nodes at the Data Layer of ctrlX CORE or ctrlX CORE Virtual can be accessed.
The sample requires that datalayer.provider.all-data is running or installed first on ctrlX CORE device.

## Prerequisites

* Build environment - we recommend a QEMU virtual machine
* ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK archive
* ctrlX CORE<sup>virtual</sup> or ctrlX CORE

### Prerequisites for Building the cpp Samples on the Build Environment

* Start your build environment
* Copy the ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK archive from your host computer to your build environment:

    scp -P 10022 com.boschrexroth.sdk.control-*.zip boschrexroth@localhost:~

* Open a SSH shell on your build environment:

    ssh -p 10022 boschrexroth@localhost

* Unzip the archive

    unzip -XK com.boschrexroth.sdk.control-*.zip

* Change to SDK directory public
* Set x flag: 

    chmod +x bin\oss.flatbuffers\u*\release\flatc

* If installed remove older ctrlx-datalayer package

    sudo dpkg -r ctrlx-datalayer 

* Install newest ctrlx-datalayer package

    sudo dpkg -i deb/ctrlx-datalayer*.deb

## Getting Started

1. Launch IDE (VSCode for example)
2. Open the sample directory `samples-cpp/datalayer.client`
3. Build and install the snap as described in `Setup` section
4. Check output in the web interface


## Troubleshooting

All automatically created files are located in folders `build` and `generated`.  
If there are unclear messages during the build process, it might help to delete the folders `build` and `generated` and restart the build process.
