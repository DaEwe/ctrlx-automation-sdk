# README datalayer.client.bulk

## Introduction

The sample demonstrates how to use bulk operations to handle values of the ctrlX Data Layer. 

## Function Description

Bulk operations should be used if the same operation (read, write, create,...) has to be done on a set of nodes.
The code is compact and the performance is much better than single operations.

## Implementation Description 

The module __main.py__ connects to the Data Layer and handles the Data Layer access.
