# Overview

Applications (snaps) for ctrlX CORE targets can be written in several programming language or even as shell scripts.

For creating your own applications, the ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK offers sample projects that can be used directly or as templates. The sample projects are saved in sub folders according to their programming language or their type. 


Here an overview of the sample project types and their subfolders.


| Sample Project Type | Description                | Link to Projects                                       |

!!! important
    All project folders are containing build scripts to create both an amd64 snap for a ctrlX CORE <sup>virtual</sup> and an arm64 snap for a ctrlX CORE M3/4.
