
# Setting up a Native Ubuntu as SDK Build Environment

You can install an Ubuntu Desktop or Ubuntu Server operating system on your computer, depending on your requirements.

The setup is very similar to the setup of a SDK VirtualBox VM. So here we will refer to the corresponding chapters of this setup document and explain the changes.

* __Setup Corporate Proxy (Optional)__: Instead of 'http://10.0.2.2:3128/' use your specific settings for http and https
* __Setup Packages__: No changes here
* __Dependencies for Crossbuild (Multiarch)__: No changes here
* __Install Visual Studio Code__: Only if you are using Ubuntu Desktop
