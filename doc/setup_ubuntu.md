You can install a Ubuntu Desktop or Ubuntu Server on your real machine, depending on your requirements.

The setup of your real machine is similar to the setup of a VirtualBox VM. So here we will refer to the corresponding chapters of this setup document and explain the changes.

* __Setup Corporate Proxy (Optional)__: Instead of 'http://10.0.2.2:3128/' use your specific settings for http and https
* __Setup Packages__: No changes here
* __Dependencies for Crossbuild (Multiarch)__: No changes here
* __Install Visual Studio Code__: Only if you are using Ubuntu Desktop
