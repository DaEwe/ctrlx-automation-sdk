# Setup Overview

## Indroduction

To develop ctrlX CORE applications with the ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK we need a so called App Build Environment which is a Ubuntu 20.04 Linux operating system with a special set of software packages and certain settings.

There are several alternatives for such an enviroment:

## QEMU Virtual Machine as App Build Environemnt

We recommend to use a QEMU Virtual Machine as App Build Environment. There are two ways to install, setup and run such a VM: 

1. __Recommended:__ [ctrlX WORKS integrated feature App Build Environment](./setup_qemu_ctrlx_works.md)
2. [Script based installation for both Windows and Linux host](./setup_qemu_ubuntu.md)

## Further Alternatives

* [Manually installed virtual machine based on Virtual Box (SDK VirtualBox VM)](./setup_windows_virtualbox_ubuntu.md)
* [Manually installed native Ubuntu environment](./setup_ubuntu.md)
